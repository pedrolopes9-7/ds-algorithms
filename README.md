# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

The purpose of this repo is to create a library and REST API for fundamental data structures and algorithms.

I've created this repo to study for coding interviews, and at the same time, to build something real using Spring Boot and cool Java 15 features. 

This is showing to be very helpful to me for studying. If you want to use some code for your education, or contribute with more algorithms, please get in touch.

## Current state:

- Self-balanced generic and iterable BST's.
